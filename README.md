# Student_Registration_System

It's a personal project for practicing JDBC and Javafx. It won't have all the functionalities that you will normally expect, it just kinda works. I know, the UI sucks, but that's okay :D.

## Usage

Download the latest demo in RELEASE, it uses h2 in-memory database, so no DBMS is required. You just run it as follows:

    java -jar stu_reg_sys-demo-1.0.0.jar
